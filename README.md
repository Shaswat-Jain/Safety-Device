# Safety-Device
Arduino Nano Code for a Safety Device.


There are two parts to this project:
1)A band that can be worn by the person (which consists of the SOS button which when pressed calls the person whose number is registered in the code and also sends an SMS along with the current location.)

2)The receiver section of the project should be carried by the user here an Arduino Nano can be used which is interfaced with a NEO6M GSM (for sending an alert) and a SIM900A GPS module ( to track the location coordinates ).

The RF Transmitter (the band) and Receiver module (to be carried by the user) is used for wireless communication between the Band and Receiving device with GPS/GSM.
